      <h1>Motivation</h1>

      <h5 class="w3-text-grey">The self-driving problem requires detecting and localizing a variety of object classes with high confidence so 
	  that the robot can understand its surroundings and reason about how to interact with the flow of traffic to maintain both driver and 
	  civilian safety. Modern self-driving methods accomplish this by utilizing a mixture of sensor modalities to better understand the current 
	  environment of the car. This combination of sensors strengthens the overall system by covering the shortcomings of each individual sensor 
	  alone. For example, LIDAR sensors are accurate and consistent, but expensive and easily obfuscated by dust. Alternatively, image data is 
	  dense and cheap but also inconsistent and inaccurate. Therefore, modern self-driving vehicles depend on the fusion of multiple modalities 
	  to ensure accuracy and consistency.  Training networks that can handle the information from multiple modalities, and even provide 
	  multiplicative strengths, is essential to improving the capability of self-driving algorithms.</h5>

      <h1>Prior Work</h1>
	  <h5 class="w3-text-grey">Self-driving is a hot research area currently, but not that many papers have been written about Lidar-camera sensor 
	  fusion for object detection and localization. In [1], Wen and Jo achieve sensor fusion by converting the Lidar information into voxels and 
	  superimposing it onto the camera images. In [2], Yang, Liang, and Urtasun propose a method for either using high-definition maps as the basis 
	  for a prior, or converting the streamed Lidar data into a 3-d map that can subsequently be used for object detection from a top-down perspective.
	  In [3],  a variety of architectures are used to combine Lidar and camera information, specifically early vs late fusion. Early fusion methods 
	  start by combining the Lidar and camera information, before passing anything through the networks. Late fusion methods pass raw or transformed 
	  data into networks to develop a series of features. These features are then fused and passed through a detection head. In [4], Vora, Lang, Helou, 
	  and Beijbom start by creating a segmentation filter over the 2-dimensional image. This semantic painting is then projected onto the lidar point 
	  cloud, from which 3d bounding boxes are developed. In [5], Salazar-Gomez, Saavedra-Ruiz, and Romero-Cano use frustum region proposals generated 
	  by 2D object detectors to segment LiDAR point clouds into point clusters.</h5>

<!-- Our Idea -->

  <div class="w3-content">
      <h1>Our Idea</h1>
      <h3 class="w3-padding-32">What is the idea?</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-text-grey">The central idea is to fuse LiDAR and camera data together to produce robust, 3D object detection (x, y, z, r, p, y) 
	  for use in self-driving applications. The purpose of using both LiDAR and camera data is because the camera data can provide strong textural 
	  understanding of where cars are located in the image, while the LiDAR data can provide highly-accurate depth information. However, the difficulty 
	  with working with LiDAR point cloud data is that they are large in size (~100MB per point cloud) and are unstructured (as opposed to image data 
	  that has constant pixel dimensions). We project features from the camera data onto the LiDAR data, which places all of the information into a 
	  common embedding shape, allowing us to easily fuse the data via concatenation. This fused data is then processed with a resnet backbone and a 
	  YOLO detection head. The reason we used YOLO was because our network is aiming at online applications and this makes YOLO’s speed more favorable 
	  over a small increase in accuracy.</h5>

	  <br>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Data Preprocessing</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-text-grey">The RGB images come from the KITTI dataset at 1242x375 pixels. We resize each image to a 448x448 pixel square to fit the 
	  pre-trained ResNet image encoder and augment the images with color jitter and gaussian noise to prevent overfitting. The point cloud comes from 
	  the KITTI dataset as a binary file. We translate the binary into an Np x 4 tensor of (x,y,z,R) where Np is the number of points in the cloud. For 
	  data augmentation, we add random gaussian noise to the x, y, z, and R values of each point.</h5>

	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Point Cloud Embedding</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-text-grey">The point cloud embedding process is as follows. We create an L x W x N grid, where L is the length, W is the width, and 
	  N is the max number of lidar points that a grid can store. If there are less points in the cell than N, we pad them with zero and note down the 
	  number of real points. If there are more than N points per cell, we randomly select N points from it to get an estimated distribution. The voxel 
	  grid is then unrolled into a P x N x D matrix, where P is L x W and D is 4. The D dimension stores the (x, y, z, r) tuple for each lidar point. Next 
	  we do point augmentation to go from D = 4 to D = 9. The 5 new pieces of information are x, y, z offset from the x, y, z mean of points in their 
	  corresponding cell, and the x and y offset from each cell center point. This is then passed through several linear layers to extract learned features, 
	  such that the result matrix is P x N x C, where C is 128 or 256. We max along the N dimension and reshape back to L x W x C, which is critical because 
	  our point cloud embedding thus preserves its spatial relationship.</h5>

	  <div class="w3-twothird">
		  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Image Embedding </h5>
		  <h5 class="w3-text-grey">For our image embedder we fine tuned resnet18, but did not use its last 3 layers. The resulting matrix is C x M x M. M is 
		  the output shape of the image. We then resize this to C x L x W.</h5>
		  <br>
		  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Sensor Fusion</h5>
		  <h5 class="w3-text-grey">We have a C x L x W lidar embedding and a C x L x W image embedding. We concatenate them to get a 2C x L x W fused embedding.</h5>

	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Detection Head</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-text-grey">The detection head at the end of our architecture was a reimplementation of YOLO. YOLO’s end-to-end training allows us to quickly 
	  generate 3D bounding boxes from our input data, along with confidence scores for each of them. Similar to 2D YOLO, we did not directly predict the raw values, 
	  because they would be numerically stable. For example, objects can be 2, 20, or 120 meters away from our vehicle, orders of magnitude different. This would 
	  cause a number of problems with YOLO’s output because it isn’t flexible or precise enough to handle such large variations in some variables, but only differences 
	  from 0 to 1 in other variables. Therefore, to create some similarity between the YOLO outputs, the YOLO head predicts the offset from each cell corner that is 
	  normalized to the cell height and width. Furthermore, instead of predicting the shape of the bbox, we predict the shape offset from an ‘average’ shape, these are 
	  known as anchor boxes. Together, these changes result in YOLO outputting numbers roughly between 0 and 1 for all of  YOLO’s diverse outputs. Lastly, predicting 
	  the yaw angle in Euler angles is difficult due to wrap around, for example the loss function will consider 0.1 degree and 359.9 degree to be far apart when in 
	  reality they are almost identical. Therefore, we predict the real and imaginary components of the yaw angle with complex decomposition. For the loss function, we 
	  first create an obj mask to mark down which of the cells contains a ground truth, and a noobj mask which is an inverse of the obj mask. We use the obj mask to 
	  ensure that we are only penalizing the model for having incorrect object-related losses when there is a ground truth result in the given cell. The noobj loss is 
	  used to penalize false positives. We use Mean Square Error on each of the loss types (obj confidence, no obj confidence, coordinate, shape, and angle), and tune 
	  the weights of each of these losses.</h5>

	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Learning Rate</h5>
	  <h5 class="w3-text-grey">Our initial learning rate of 1e-2 seemed to work well for our training purposes, but when plotted on a logarithmic scale it became 
	  clear that our learning rate only functioned correctly for the first 10 or 20 epochs. Therefore, we made an adjustment to our method and added a step-based 
	  learning rate scheduler that cut the learning rate by a tenth every ten epochs, down to a minimum of 1e-6. After implementing this learning rate scheduler, 
	  our model trained excellently, continuing to reduce its loss even after running for 30 or more epochs. In total, our loss dropped from an initial value of 
	  1 all the way down to 1e-4. This is particularly important for our application as localizing 3d bounding boxes with sufficient IoU is difficult to achieve 
	  or improve and our YOLO detection head has a complex loss that requires minimizing along multiple dimensions.</h5>

	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h3 class="w3-padding-32">Why does your idea make sense intuitively?</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-text-grey"> This idea makes intuitive sense because it combines the strengths of different types of sensors. Lidars are useful for 
	  determining the precise 3D coordinates of objects in a scene, and cameras are good for classifying objects. Fusing these two sensors can provide 
	  robust classification and localization. However, fusing these two sensors requires a good representation of each. Cameras are straight forward, 
	  but lidar embeddings are still an area of active research. By creating a latent embedding space that is the same for each sensor we make the process 
	  of fusing the data rather straightforward.</h5>
	  <br>
	  <h3 class="w3-padding-32">How does it relate to prior work in the area?</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-text-grey"> We took the ideas of sensor fusion in 3D LiDAR-based datasets and applied new and improved object detection algorithms 
	  to see the performance. The prior work listed has provided various sensor fusion methods with various learning methods, we built off of various 
	  successes found in their work to combine into a novel system for 3D object detection.</h5>

	<h5 class="w3-padding-32">Negative Results / Model Challenges</h5>
	<h5 class="w3-text-grey">Our model struggled with cars in the far distances, particularly due to the sparsity of point cloud points making the YOLO 
	discrete 3D space miss it. As far as self-driving is concerned, this is not an issue because a car that’s too far away to detect is not in danger of 
	an immediate collision. Additionally, the model mAP was reduced when it identified trucks as cars because the ground truth has trucks labeled separately 
	from cars, but in our model implementation this would be standardly correct as we are trying to detect all vehicles in a self-driving application. The 
	model output shown below expresses these challenges with a detection on a truck that does not match up with a ground truth car box as well as a car in 
	the far field that is not detected.</h5>
